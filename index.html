<p> I am a 4th year <a href=https://ece.ncsu.edu/grad/phd/>Computer Engineering</a> PhD Student at <a href=https://www.ncsu.edu/>North Carolina State University</a>. I am working under the supervision of <a href=https://sacagroup.github.io/>prof. Amro Awad</a>. My research focuses primarily on secure and reliable computer architecture. For the past few years, I have been extensively looking at the security and reliability of emerging memory technologies such as Non-Volatile Memory (NVM). Apart from exploring novel designs for secure memory architecture, I have also led one of the major tasks in a DARPA project that aims to design FPGA-based secure memory architecture. My work has been published in top-tier computer architecture conferences such as ISCA, MICRO and HPCA. Please refer to the <a href=publications.html>publication</a> and <a href=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oM4qP5UAAAAJ&hl=en>Google Scholar</a> page for more details of my research and publications.</p>

	<p> I have received my BS degree in Applied Physics, Electronics & Communicaiton Engineering from University of Chittagong, Bangladesh. Before my Ph.D., I have worked for several years in <a href=https://stellarbd.com/>StellarBD</a> and <a href=https://ibsl-bd.com/>IBSL</a> as an Embedded Systems Engineer. You can learn more about me from my <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/kzubair-bd/>Linkedin</a> profile.  </p>
